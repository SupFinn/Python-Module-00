## 📌 Description

**Growing Code** is an introductory Python project designed to help students learn **core programming concepts** through simple, meaningful, and real-world inspired exercises.

By working with **community garden data**, you’ll explore how Python can be used to:
- Process input and output  
- Perform calculations  
- Make decisions  
- Repeat actions  
- Structure clean and readable code  

This project focuses on **learning by doing**, encouraging curiosity, experimentation, and understanding — not memorization.
